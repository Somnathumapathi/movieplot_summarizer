        "By 2024, Gandhi has left SATS and is working as an immigration officer at Chennai International Airport. He and Anu live separately, and their daughter, Jeevitha, lives with Anu. Upon Kalyan's suggestion, Gandhi's former boss, Nazeer, asks him to go to Moscow to train new officers at the reopened Indian Embassy. Though reluctant, Gandhi agrees, but during his time there, the embassy is attacked by a gang. Gandhi fights them off and is shocked to see one of the attackers, a young doppelgänger. He realizes it is Jeevan and confirms this when he helps him fend off the attackers. They return to Chennai, and the family reunites, with Anu starting to speak to Gandhi again. Nazeer calls Gandhi for an urgent meeting at the Chennai Metro station, stating that the information is so confidential it cannot be told over the phone. A masked man attacks Nazeer. Gandhi arrives just in time to fight off the attacker, but the masked man kills Nazeer. The masked figure is later revealed to be Jeevan and Gandhi swears to find the killer and take revenge for Naseer’s death.\n",

        "Gandhi returns to SATS to find who is trying to cause a threat to their agency. Nazeer's phone has all the information about Jeevan and his gang from Moscow. Jeevan's accomplice Sha took the phone from Nazeer in the Metro station when Nazeer dropped it. But Sha reveals to Jeevan that the phone went missing. It is found that Jeevan has been working for Menon all this time and has come to Gandhi's family for a reason.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is also revealed that Menon survived the train explosion in 2008 but lost his wife and children in the incident. Seeking revenge, he tracked Gandhi to Bangkok, kidnapped Jeevan, and placed him in a juvenile facility, instilling fear in him. He then \"rescued\" Jeevan by killing the members of the facility, earning his trust and renaming him Sanjay after his deceased son. Jeevan, manipulated by Menon, came to believe Gandhi was responsible for the deaths of his family. Fueled by this hatred, Jeevan dedicated his life to Menon and his revenge on Gandhi.\n",

        "Two men waiting at the Biju Patnaik Airport (in Bhubaneswar, Odisha, for a flight to Chennai, Tamil Nadu) engage in conversation. One is a commercial director, Anbarasu, who prefers the abbreviated name A. Aras, and the other is a scarred and deformed socialist, Nallasivam, going by Mr. Sivam. When the flight is cancelled due to heavy rain, Aras initially suspects Sivam to be a terrorist and informs the authorities, only to discover that he was mistaken. With the rain flooding the city, the two men are forced to share a room for the night. Both need to return to Chennai: Aras to be present at his wedding, and Sivam has to deliver a ₹32,00,000[a] cheque, recently awarded to him after he won a court case, to a group of union workers.\n",
        "\n",
        "After a traumatic night, and no hope for a flight, the two men take a bus to board the Coromandel Express train. Aras's bag gets stolen on the way, leaving him with only his credit card, which no one accepts. Using his presence of mind, Sivam repeatedly bails Aras out of trouble while Aras tries to escape from him at every juncture, only to end up with him again. While waiting for the train at the Ichchapuram railway station (in Andhra Pradesh), Sivam begins to tell Aras his story.\n",
        "\n",
        "A few years earlier, a healthy Nallasivam, going by Nalla, took part in various street theatre performances protesting against multinational corporation-driven industrialisation, which resulted in the marginalisation of the labour force. He was at odds with Kandasamy Padayatchi, a manipulative factory owner who refused to give his workers a raise. Nalla satirically imitated Padayatchi in many of his shows. In an unexpected turn of events, Nalla and Balasaraswathi (Bala), Padayatchi's daughter, fell in love with each other. To avoid a potential conflict with Padayatchi, the two decided to elope to Kerala.\n",
        "\n",
        "Nalla boarded a bus bound for Kerala, and on his way to meet Bala, the bus met with an accident on a hillside, leaving him scarred, disfigured, and partially paralysed for life. After recovering from his wounds, he visited Bala, only to be informed by Padayatchi that his daughter was already married and pregnant with her first child, and had settled abroad. Padayatchi had earlier lied to Bala that Nalla died in the accident. It was also at this time that Nalla became a firm believer in kindness and love after experiencing patience and compassion from the nurses at the hospital. Despite suffering from an inferiority complex due to his scarred and deformed body, Nalla performs community service and social work with renewed fervour while continuing to fight for union causes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Upon their arrival in Chennai, Aras delivers Sivam's cheque to the union workers. He invites Sivam to his wedding, letting him know how much he means to him, to utter astonishment, Sivam sees that Aras's bride is Bala. Padayatchi spots Sivam and asks him why he is at the wedding. He tells Padayatchi that he was invited by Aras, and later persuades him to sign the papers which will help Padayatchi's workers get a raise. To prevent the disruption of Bala's wedding and avoid damaging his own reputation, Padayatchi yields to Sivam's demands. After signing the papers, Padayatchi instructs his assistant to eliminate Sivam. However, his assistant has a change of heart as he is about to kill him, letting Sivam know that he believed that the misdeeds he committed for Padayatchi resulted in the death of his own daughter. Padayatchi's assistant requests Sivam to stay as far away from his boss as possible. Sivam assents and walks away.\n",
